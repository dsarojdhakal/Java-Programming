Introduction to Applet
----------------------

An applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser or an applet viewer. Applets are used to provide interactive features to web applications that cannot be provided by HTML alone.

Key Points:
- Applets are subclasses of `java.applet.Applet` or `javax.swing.JApplet`.
- They are embedded in HTML pages using the `<applet>` tag (deprecated) or `<object>`/`<embed>` tags.
- Applets have a well-defined life cycle managed by the browser or applet viewer.

Standard Applet Methods
-----------------------

The following are the standard methods in the applet life cycle:

1. `init()`
    - Called once when the applet is first loaded.
    - Used for initialization.

2. `start()`
    - Called after `init()` and every time the applet is revisited.
    - Used to start or resume execution.

3. `stop()`
    - Called when the user leaves the applet's page.
    - Used to suspend execution.

4. `destroy()`
    - Called when the applet is about to be destroyed.
    - Used for cleanup.

5. `paint(Graphics g)`
    - Called to redraw the applet's output.
    - Used for rendering graphics.



    Comparison between Applet and Application
    -----------------------------------------

    | Feature           | Applet                                      | Application                          |
    |-------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
    | Execution         | Runs inside a web browser or applet viewer  | Runs independently on the desktop    |
    | Main Method       | Does not have `main()` method               | Has a `main()` method                |
    | User Interface    | Uses AWT/Swing for GUI                      | Uses AWT/Swing/JavaFX for GUI        |
    | Security          | Runs in a restricted sandbox environment    | Has full access to system resources  |
    | Life Cycle        | Managed by browser/applet viewer            | Managed by the programmer            |
    | Deployment        | Embedded in HTML pages                      | Distributed as JAR/executable files  |
