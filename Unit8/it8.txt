a. Introduction to Servlet and JSP and its Architecture

    Servlet

        Java program that runs on a web server.

        Handles requests and responses in web applications.

        Works on server-side to generate dynamic content.

        Extends the HttpServlet class for HTTP-based services.
        
        Servlet → Handles business logic (processing, database operations).

        Features

            Platform-independent (Java-based).

            Efficient and fast (uses multithreading).

            Secure and portable.


    JSP (JavaServer Pages)

        Technology to create dynamic web pages using HTML + Java code.

        Easier to write than Servlets (less Java code, more HTML).

        Compiled into a Servlet by the server during first execution.

        Best suited for presentation logic.

        Features

            Allows mixing Java code with HTML using special tags.

            Supports tag libraries (JSTL).

            Automatically managed lifecycle by the server.


        Servlet → Handles business logic (processing, database operations).

        JSP → Handles presentation logic (UI).

        Together they follow MVC architecture.



    Servlet Architecture

        Client sends HTTP request (e.g., from browser).

        Web Server (e.g., Tomcat) passes request to Servlet container.

        Servlet processes request, interacts with database if needed.

        Servlet sends the result to the Web Server.

        Web Server sends the final response back to the Client.


    JSP Architecture

        Client requests .jsp file.

        Server converts JSP into a Servlet (only the first time).

        Generated Servlet is compiled into a .class file.

        Servlet processes the request, interacts with the database if needed.

        Servlet sends the result to the Web Server.

        Web Server sends the final HTML response back to the Client.


b. Configuring Apache Tomcat to Host Servlet/JSP Files

    Apache Tomcat is a free, open-source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation.

    In simple terms:

    It is software that runs Java-based web applications.

    It understands Servlet and JSP code and turns them into working web pages.

    It follows Java EE specifications for web technologies.
